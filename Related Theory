Theory Explanation:
Sorting the strings:

After sorting, the first string (word1) and the last string (word2) in the list will have the smallest and largest lexicographical order, respectively.
Any common prefix between the first and last string will be the longest common prefix for the entire list of strings. This works because sorting groups similar strings together.
Finding the prefix:

The while loop compares the characters of word1 and word2 until either:
A mismatch occurs, or
The shorter string is fully traversed.
Common characters are added to the result string s.
Returning the result:

The longest common prefix is stored in s and returned.
Space Complexity:
Auxiliary Space: The function uses a constant amount of extra space (O(1)) for variables like s, word1, word2, i, and p.
Sorting Space: Sorting the vector requires O(m × log m) space in the worst case, where m is the size of the strs vector.
Final Space Complexity: O(1) auxiliary space, but O(m × log m) for sorting.
Time Complexity:
Sorting the vector:

Sorting the vector takes O(m × log m), where m is the number of strings in the vector. If the average string length is n, then sorting complexity is O(m × n × log m).
Finding the common prefix:

Comparing the first and last strings takes O(n), where n is the length of the shortest string in the vector.
Final Time Complexity: O(m × n × log m), dominated by the sorting operation.
Overall Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(m × n × log m), where m is the number of strings and n is the average length of the strings.
Space Complexity: O(1) auxiliary space, with O(m × log m) for sorting.
This solution is efficient for a moderate number of strings but could be optimized further for very large datasets.
